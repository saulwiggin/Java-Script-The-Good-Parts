FDTD-Simulations-Of-A-Metamaterial-Lens
=======================================
This Repo Contains the MATLAB scripts for Finite Difference- Time Domain Simulations for a Metamaterial Cooke Triplet. The Idea was to simulate a lens based on Transformation Optics which would have the same Ray Propagation characteristics as a Cooke Triplet and therefore (in theory) the same improved performance in terms of imaging aberrations.
